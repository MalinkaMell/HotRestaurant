# HotRestaurant - week 14 challenge activity

Demo of the project: <https://limitless-taiga-33344.herokuapp.com/>

* Description: Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.
* Live Demo: <https://hot-restaurant-fsf.herokuapp.com>

### Bonuses achieved:

* Add buttons for "checking off" individuals from the reservation list. Once this happens, the next person on the waitlist should be addd to the main reservation list.

* Add code to your server so that it "counts" every time a person visits any of the pages. Display a running count on the website.

* Add a button for sending emails to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use node-mailer or a similar npm package to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).

* Add a button for sending text messages to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use the Twilio library to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).
